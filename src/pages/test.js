          From Richard <b> Hamming’s 經典著作</b> classic and 必讀 must-read talk,
          “<a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html">
            You and Your Research

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            There is indeed an element of luck (運氣), and no, there isn’t. The prepared
            mind sooner or later finds something important and does it. So yes, it
            is luck.{" "}
            <em>
              The particular thing you do is luck, but that you do something is
              not.
            </em>
